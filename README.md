# Jigsaw Puzzle
The present project is an implementation of a basic Jigsaw puzzle on the Corona Simulator aka Solar 2d with Lua.

The game consists of *three levels*, which just vary based on the number of pieces that need to be put together:
- Level 1 is a three by three Puzzle
- Level 2 is a five by five Puzzle
- Level 3 is a fifteen by fifteen Puzzle
